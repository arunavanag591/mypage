I am currently a 4th-year Computer Science Ph.D. Student at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research focuses on understanding how flies might track odor in outdoors (profile picture of collecting plume data in Black Rock Desert, Nevada). I use <b>physics based statistical modeling</b>, <b>generative AI</b>, for odor localization and simulating realistic odor experiences. I also fly UAVs, and work with my fellow lab mates to investigate how flies might be using optic flow, and actually measure the <b>level of observability</b> along a trajectory. Here are some preliminary [work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/ac1f7b) in that direction. I also instruct [ME 203](https://catalog.unr.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=50&poid=149770#) - Introduction to Computer Methods at the University of Nevada, Reno.


I completed my MS in Electrical Engineering at North Carolina State University in 2016. My [thesis](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.16/11399) involved working with vision guided collaborative robotics for manufacturing appplications. After which I worked as a Senior Research Engineer at ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific, where I developed industrial applications using machine learning, robotics, autonomous navigation, computer vision and virtual reality. I also worked as an instructor for Robot Operating System while my stint at ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific. 

I am proficient in Python, C++, and ROS, and have a deep understanding of various algorithms and data structures. A list of my [publications](https://arunavanag591.github.io/about/publications/) and github repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/arunavanag591).To stay connected or learn more about my research, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunavanag/) profile.
