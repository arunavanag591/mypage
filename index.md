I am currently a 4th-year Computer Science Ph.D. Student at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research focuses on understanding how flies might track odor in outdoors (profile picture of collecting plume data in Black Rock Desert, Nevada). My work revolves around using data driven modeling and machine learning for 

1. Odor Source Localization in Real World Scenarios
2. Data Driven plume simulators offering realistic spatio-temporal odor experience using predictive modeling
3. Odor based navigation in drone using plume model and path solvers. 

You can check my latest preprint in odor source localization[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.20.549973v1).


I completed my MS in Electrical Engineering at North Carolina State University in 2016. My [thesis](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.16/11399) involved working with vision guided collaborative robotics for manufacturing appplications. After which I worked as a Senior Research Engineer at ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific, where I developed industrial applications using machine learning, robotics, autonomous navigation, computer vision and virtual reality. I also worked as an instructor for Robot Operating System while my stint at ROS-Industrial Asia Pacific. 

I am proficient in Python, C++, and ROS, and have a deep understanding of various algorithms and data structures. A list of my [publications](https://arunavanag591.github.io/about/publications/) and github repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/arunavanag591).I also instruct [ME 203](https://catalog.unr.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=50&poid=149770#) - Introduction to Computer Methods at the University of Nevada, Reno.
